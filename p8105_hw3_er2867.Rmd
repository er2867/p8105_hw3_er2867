```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(p8105.datasets)

install.packages("ggthemes")
install.packages("viridis")
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
devtools::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")

```

 load the  BRFSS data data from the p8105.datasets package.
```
```
```{r problem 1}
data(brfss_smart2010)
View(brfss_smart2010)
```

format the data to use appropriate variable names;
focus on the “Overall Health” topic
include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Excellent” to “Poor”
```{r}
brfss_smart =
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = (c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))) %>% 
  arrange(response) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations? - CT, FL, NC
```{r}
brfss_smart_2002 = 
  brfss_smart %>%  
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  select(locationdesc, locationabbr) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  count(locationabbr) %>% 
  filter(n == 7)

```
Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.
  As the dataset covers the years from 2002-2010, no need to select specific years
```{r}
brfss_smart_spaghetti =
  brfss_smart %>%  
  group_by(locationabbr,year) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) 

ggplot(brfss_smart_spaghetti, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = locationabbr)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
   

```

Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.
```{r}
brfss_smart_NY = 
  brfss_smart %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY") %>% 
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  filter (year == 2002| year == 2006| year == 2010) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_excellent = mean(excellent, na.rm = TRUE),
      sd_excellent = sd (excellent, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
   knitr::kable()
  
```

For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.
```{r}
brfss_all = 
  brfss_smart%>%
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr,year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_excellent = mean(excellent, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_very_good = mean(very_good, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_good = mean(good, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_fair = mean(fair, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_poor = mean(poor, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  gather(key = response, value = mean, "mean_poor","mean_fair","mean_good","mean_very_good","mean_excellent")
  
ggplot (brfss_all,aes(x = year, y = mean))+ 
  facet_grid (~response)+
  geom_line(aes(color = locationabbr))
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```


Problem 2 - load data from p8105 datasets
```{r}
data(instacart)
View(instacart)
```
 write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations- The dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 columns, which include numerical variables like 'aisle_id', as well as charecter vectors such as 'aisle'
 
```{r}
nrow(instacart)
ncol(instacart)
```
 How many aisles are there? - 134
```{r}
n_aisles =
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(aisle_id, aisle) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  nrow
```
 which aisles are the most items ordered from - Aisle 83 and 24
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle_id) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n > 100000) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle. Order aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.
```{r}
instacart_number =
  instacart%>% 
  group_by(aisle_id) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  rename(number_items = n)
View(instacart_number)  

ggplot(instacart_number, aes(x = aisle_id, y = number_items)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_x_discrete()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

```

Make a table showing the most popular item in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
```{r}
instacart_popular = 
  instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients"|aisle == "dog food care"|aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarise(most_pop = max(product_name, na.rm = TRUE),
            most_pop= max(product_name, na.rm = TRUE),
            most_pop = max(product_name, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
            knitr::kable()

```
Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
```{r}

instacart_hour =
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples"|product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>% 
  mutate(dow = (order_dow + 1)) %>% 
  group_by(dow) %>% 
  summarise(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  mutate(dayz = wday(dow, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(round_hour = round(mean_hour)) %>% 
  select(round_hour, dayz)
  knitr::kable()

```
Problem 3 - upload ny_noaa
```{r}
data(ny_noaa)
View(ny_noaa)

```
write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and indicating the extent to which missing data is an issue - This dataset is 2595176 rows, and 7 columns, with the key variables are temperature min/max, and variables for percipitation and snow, by date and id#. There appears to be a substantial amount of missing data

Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and day. 
```{r}
ny_noaa_separate = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"))  
  
```

Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values? Why? - 0 is the most common value - it does not snow every day
```{r}
ny_noaa_snow =
  ny_noaa_separate %>% 
  count(snow) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n > 100) 
 
ny_noaa_unit = 
  ny_noaa_separate %>% 
  mutate(tmax = as.integer(tmax),
    tmax_unit = (tmax / 10)) %>% 
  mutate (tmin = as.integer(tmin),
    tmin_unit = (tmin / 10)) %>% 
  select(year, month, day, prcp, snow, snwd, tmax_unit, tmin_unit)

```
make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years. Is there any observable / interpretable structure? Any outliers? - There are cold outliers in July in 1989, 1991, 2000, and 2006. There are warm outliers in 1995 and 2005. Structurally, the data appears bimodal, with january significantly colder than july. 
```{r}
ny_noaa_plot = 
  ny_noaa_unit%>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = as.integer(month)) %>% 
  filter(month == 01|month == 07) %>% 
  group_by(month, year,tmax_unit) %>% 
  summarise(mean_tmax_unit = mean(tmax_unit, na.rm = TRUE))
  
 ggplot (ny_noaa_plot,aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax_unit))+ 
  facet_grid (~month)+
  geom_point()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
   labs(
  title = "average max temp in January and July"
   ) + 
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```
Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset (note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less than 100 separately by year.
```{r}
install.packages("hexbin")
library(hexbin)
library(patchwork)

noaa_snow = 
  ny_noaa_unit %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(snow < 100 & snow > 0)

noaa_tmax_tmin_p = ggplot (ny_noaa_unit, aes(x = tmax_unit, y = tmin_unit))+ 
  geom_hex()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
   labs(
  title = "Temperature Max vs Min",
    x = "maximum temp",
    y = "minimum temp")

snow_year_p = ggplot(noaa_snow, aes(x = year, y = snow)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
  title = "Snowfall by year",
  x = "Year",
  y = "snowfall") 

#combining plots with patchwork:
noaa_tmax_tmin_p + snow_year_p

```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
