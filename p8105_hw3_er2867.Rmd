```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(p8105.datasets)

install.packages("ggthemes")
install.packages("viridis")
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
devtools::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")

```

 load the  BRFSS data data from the p8105.datasets package.
```
```
```{r problem 1}
data(brfss_smart2010)
View(brfss_smart2010)
```

format the data to use appropriate variable names;
focus on the “Overall Health” topic
include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor”
organize responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Excellent” to “Poor”
```{r}
brfss_smart =
  brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = (c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))) %>% 
  arrange(response) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations? - CT, FL, NC
```{r}
brfss_smart_2002 = 
  brfss_smart %>%  
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  select(locationdesc, locationabbr) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  count(locationabbr) %>% 
  filter(n == 7)

```
Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.
  As the dataset covers the years from 2002-2010, no need to select specific years
```{r}
brfss_smart_spaghetti =
  brfss_smart %>%  
  group_by(locationabbr,year) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) 

ggplot(brfss_smart_spaghetti, aes(x = year, y = n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = locationabbr)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
   

```

Make a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.
```{r}
brfss_smart_NY = 
  brfss_smart %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY") %>% 
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  filter (year == 2002| year == 2006| year == 2010) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_excellent = mean(excellent, na.rm = TRUE),
      sd_excellent = sd (excellent, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
   knitr::kable()
  
```

For each year and state, compute the average proportion in each response category (taking the average across locations in a state). Make a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.
```{r}
brfss_all = 
  brfss_smart%>%
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr,year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_excellent = mean(excellent, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_very_good = mean(very_good, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_good = mean(good, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_fair = mean(fair, na.rm = TRUE), 
    mean_poor = mean(poor, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  gather(key = response, value = mean, "mean_poor","mean_fair","mean_good","mean_very_good","mean_excellent")
  
ggplot (brfss_all,aes(x = year, y = mean))+ 
  facet_grid (~response)+
  geom_line(aes(color = locationabbr))
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```


Problem 2 - load data from p8105 datasets
```{r}
data(instacart)
View(instacart)
```
 write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations.
 
```{r}
nrow(instacart)
ncol(instacart)
```
 How many aisles are there? - 134
```{r}
n_aisles =
  instacart %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(aisle_id, aisle) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  nrow
```
 which aisles are the most items ordered from - Aisle 83 and 24
```{r}
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle_id) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n > 100000) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle. Order aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.
```{r}
instacart_number =
  instacart%>% 
  group_by(aisle_id) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  rename(number_items = n)
View(instacart_number)  

ggplot(instacart_number, aes(x = aisle_id, y = number_items)) + 
  geom_point()
```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
